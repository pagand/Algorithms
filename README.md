Linear approach for Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
This method map the array to a corresponding 2*2*(n/2) table storing all local information. This algorithms employ divide and conquer method, so in each step, the 3rd element of table gets half. The total storage required is 4*log(n). Each elements are shown in this figure.
